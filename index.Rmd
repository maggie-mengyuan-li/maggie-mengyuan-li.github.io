<br>

I graduated with simultaneous degrees (BA/BS) in Geography and Conservation & Resource Studies from UC Berkeley in 2019, specializing in spatial analysis approaches to investigate issues at the intersections of climate, health and the environment. My previous projects include measuring the environmental impacts of agricultural land use in Northern California and effects of seasonal dust loading on respiratory health in Senegal.

<br>

My current research focuses on quantifying the effects of particulate air pollution and other environmental stressors on health outcomes, with an emphasis on marginalized communities.
